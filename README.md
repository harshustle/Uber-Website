# Uber Clone

A full-stack Uber clone project built using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. The project includes various functionalities such as user authentication, ride requests, and payment integration. All APIs and React components have been created, but the map integration is pending due to map service charges.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-in and sign-up functionality for drivers and riders.
- **Driver and Rider Management**: Users can register as either a rider or a driver.
- **Trip Management**: Riders can request rides, and drivers can accept or reject ride requests.
- **Ride Status**: Real-time updates on ride status, including pickup and drop-off locations.
- **Payment Integration**: Basic payment system using Stripe (or a similar service) for fare calculation and transactions.
- **Notifications**: Push notifications for ride status updates.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, React Router, Redux
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Payment Gateway**: Stripe (or similar service)
- **State Management**: Redux
- **APIs**: Custom-built APIs for ride management, driver management, authentication, and payment.

## Pending Features

- **Map Integration**: The map feature for displaying real-time ride routes is not integrated yet due to the associated costs of using map services (Google Maps, Mapbox). However, the backend API structure is ready for integration when the map service is available.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the project locally:

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/harshustle/Uber-Website
   cd Uber-Website
